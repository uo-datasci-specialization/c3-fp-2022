### for educational data science {#subtitle}

Welcome to the third course in the [Educational Data Science](https://education.uoregon.edu/data-science-specialization-educational-leadership) specialization. 
This course builds upon the content covered in the first two courses, with a
specific focus on becoming a better programmer and improving workflows in 
statistical computing with R. Students will continue to work with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) 
suite of packages, with a emphasis on [{purrr}](https://purrr.tidyverse.org) for
functional programming. At its core, functional programming is a technique to
iterate a function over a vector, or set of vectors, to complete repetitive tasks.
We will compare and contrast {purrr} functions with base R approaches, including
`for` loops and the `apply` family of functions. Functional programming helps 
reduce redundancies in code, making it more efficient and, often, more readable.
The course will also cover writing custom functions, which can also help in
completing repetitive tasks, but can also extend the functionality of R, and is
a key component of functional programming. The course concludes with an 
introduction to [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for building interactive 
applications which, although somewhat outside of the scope of functional 
programming, requires using and writing functions.
