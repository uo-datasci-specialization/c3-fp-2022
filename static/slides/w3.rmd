	+ A small example

* Introduce you to {purrr} and contrast it with the base functions we learned last week

---
class: inverse-red middle
# Review Lab 1

---
# Learning objectives
* Understand how `purrr::map` relates to `lapply` and `for` loops

* Understand the four basic variants of `purrr::map`, when they should be used,
and when they will fail

* Understand what functional programming is, and how `{purrr}` can help
facilitate the process

# Functional Programming

---
# What is FP?
> decomposing a big problem into smaller pieces, then solving each piece with a 
function or combination of functions

# Example
### Calculate top mpg manufactures

* First, we'll subset the data to 4 cylinders. This will be the dataset we'll
solve the problem on:

```{r four_cyl, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
four_cyl <- filter(mpg, cyl == 4)
```

---
* Next, we'll filter for cases where the city miles per gallon is in the top 10% (i.e.,greater than or equal to the 90th percentile).

```{r ninety-ptile}
ninety <- four_cyl %>%
	filter(cty >= quantile(cty, probs = 0.9))
ninety
```

---
* Now count the unique occurrences for each manufacturer,
manufacturer/model, and class

```{r counts}
count_mfr <- count(ninety, manufacturer)
count_model <- count(ninety, manufacturer, model)
count_class <- count(ninety, class)
```

---
* Produce a plot for each

```{r plots1}
plot_mfr <- 
	ggplot(count_mfr, aes(fct_reorder(manufacturer, -n), n)) +
		geom_col(aes(fill = manufacturer)) +
		scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
		labs(title = "Manufacturers",
		     x = "",
		     y = "") +
		guides(fill = "none")

plot_car <- count_model %>%
	unite(car, manufacturer, model, sep = " ") %>%
	ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(car, -n), n)) +
		geom_col(aes(fill = car)) +
		scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
		labs(title = "Top 10% of city mpg",
		     subtitle = "Car frequency",
		     x = "",
		     y = "") +
		guides(fill = "none")
```

---
```{r }
plot_class <- 
  ggplot(count_class, aes(fct_reorder(class, -n), n)) +
		geom_col(aes(fill = class)) +
		scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
		labs(title = "Car Class",
		     x = "", 
		     y = "") +
		guides(fill = "none")
```

---
# Assemble the plots

```{r patchwork, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8.5}
library(patchwork)
plot_car / (plot_mfr + plot_class)
```

---
class: inverse-red middle

# Functional Programming Version
### At least in spirit

---
# Filter all
```{r filter}
by_cyl <- split(mpg, mpg$cyl)
top_10 <- lapply(by_cyl, function(x) {
	filter(x, cty >= quantile(cty, probs = 0.9))
})
str(top_10)
```

---
# All counts

```{r all-counts}
counts <- lapply(top_10, function(x) {
	count_manufacturer <- count(x, manufacturer)
	count_class <- count(x, class)

	count_model <- count(x, manufacturer, model) %>%
		unite(car, manufacturer, model, sep = " ")
	

	return(list(mfr = count_manufacturer, 
	            car = count_model, 
	            class = count_class))
})
counts
```

---
# Plots
### Let's write a couple functions
We'll mostly ignore how for now. 

```{r plot_fun}
counts_plot <- function(counts_df) {
  var <- names(counts_df)[1]
	
  p <- ggplot(counts_df, aes(fct_reorder(!!sym(var), -n), n)) +
		geom_col(aes(fill = !!sym(var))) +
		scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
		labs(title = stringr::str_to_title(var),
		     x = "",
		     y = "") +
		guides(fill = "none")

	if(var == "car") {
		p <- p + labs(title = "Top 10% of city mpg",
		              subtitle = var)
	}
 p
}
```


---
# Test it

```{r indiv_plot1, fig.width = 13}
counts_plot(counts[["4"]]$mfr)
```	

---
```{r indiv_plot2, fig.width = 13}
counts_plot(counts[["8"]]$car)
```

---
```{r indiv_plot3, fig.width = 13}
counts_plot(counts[["6"]]$class)	
```

---
# Compile plots function

```{r plot2}
full_plot <- function(l) {
	counts_plot(l[["car"]]) / (
	  counts_plot(l[["mfr"]]) +
	  counts_plot(l[["class"]])
	)
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r full_plot-test, fig.width = 13}
full_plot(counts[[1]])
```

---
# Finish up

```{r looped-full-plot}
plots <- lapply(counts, full_plot)
```

---
```{r p1}
plots[[1]]
```

---
```{r p2}
plots[[2]]
```

---
```{r p3, fig.width = 25}
plots[[3]]
```


---
```{r p4}
plots[[4]]
```

# functionals

> a function that takes a function as input and returns a vector as output.

- What does this mean?

# `purrr::map`

```{r map}

map(1:3, rnorm)
```

# Comparison to `base::lapply`

.pull-left[
### lapply
```{r lapply-map}
lapply(1:3, rnorm)
```
]

.pull-right[
### map
```{r map-lapply}
map(1:3, rnorm)
```
]

side note: What exactly is going on here?

---
> The base equivalent to `map()` is `lapply()`. The only difference is that `lapply()` does not support the helpers that you’ll learn about (next), so if you’re only using `map()` from {purrr}, you can skip the additional dependency and use `lapply()` directly.

\- [Adv R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html)

# Equivalents

The following are equivalent

```{r equivalents1, eval = FALSE}
map(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))

lapply(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))
```

--
{purrr} also allows  you to specify anonymous functions more succinctly using the formula interface

```{r formula1}
map(mtcars, ~length(unique(.x)))
```

---
class: inverse-white middle

# `~` is used in place of `function(.x)`

---
# More examples

.pull-left[

### Vary the `n`
```{r }
map(1:3, ~rnorm(n = .x))
```

]

.pull-right[

### Vary the `mean`
```{r }
map(1:3, ~rnorm(n = 1, mean = .x))
```

]

---

### vary the `sd`
```{r }
map(1:3, ~rnorm(n = 1, sd = .x))
```

---
# Extracting elements
Let's make a rather complicated list
```{r list}
l <- list(
  list(-1, x = 1, y = 2, z = "a"),
  list(-2, x = 4, y = c(5, 6), z = "b"),
  list(-3, x = 8, y = c(9, 10, 11))
)
```

--
### Extract second element from each

```{r map-extract}
map(l, 2)
```

---
### Doesn't work for `lapply`

```{r lapply-extract-fail, error = TRUE}
lapply(l, 2)
```

--
Instead, you have to apply an anonymous function

```{r lapply-extract-success1}
lapply(l, function(x) x[[2]])
```


---
Alternatively the following is also the same

```{r lapply-extract-success2}
lapply(l, `[[`, 2)
```

---
# Extract by name

```{r by_name}
map(l, "y")
```

---
# Multiple arguments

```{r by_name_arg}
map(l, list("y", 1))
```


---
class:inverse-red middle

# {purrr} variants


---
# Return a vector

* `map_dbl`
* `map_int`
* `map_chr`
* `map_lgl`

---

.pull-left[
```{r show-l}
str(l)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r map_dbl1}
map_dbl(l, "x")
map_dbl(l, 1)
```
]

---
# Type match

* Coercion will occur if you request a different type

```{r mismatched-type-coercion}
map_chr(l, "x")
```

--
* You'll get an error if element doesn't exist

```{r no-element,error = TRUE}
map_chr(l, "z")
```

---
* Unless you set a default value

```{r no-element-default-val, error = TRUE}
map_chr(l, "z", .default = NA_character_)
```

---
# Quick note: missing values
* In the prior case, specifying `NA` would work, instead of `NA_character_`


--
* Generally, I think it's better to specify the type.


--
* **General programming rule:** The more strict the better 

--
* Because (base) R likes to be inconsistent, here are the `NA` types

.pull-left[

| Type | NA value|
|:-----|:-------:|
| character | NA\_character\_ |
| integer   | NA\_integer\_ |
| double    | NA\_real\_ |
| logical   | NA (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19564748/why-is-there-no-na-logical)) |
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r log-na}
typeof(NA)
```
]

# More quick examples

Please copy the code below so you have it locally.

```{r }
df_list <- list(
  data.frame(var1 = 1:5),
  data.frame(var1 = 1:3),
  data.frame(var1 = 1)
)
```

---
# Compute `mean(var1)`
For each data frame. You try first!

`r countdown::countdown(4)`

--

```{r }
map(df_list, ~mean(.x$var1))
```

---
# Return a vector
```{r }
map_dbl(df_list, ~mean(.x$var1))
```

--

Try out coercion

```{r error = TRUE}
map_chr(df_list, ~mean(.x$var1))
map_lgl(df_list, ~mean(.x$var1))

# Manual override
map_lgl(df_list, ~as.logical(mean(.x$var1)))
```


---
# Some more examples
### Please follow along

```{r economics}
econ <- economics %>%
	mutate(year = lubridate::year(date))
econ
```

---
# by_year

```{r by_year}
by_year <- split(econ, econ$year)
str(by_year)
```

---
# Fit a simple model to each year
Notes: 
* We'll discuss a more elegant way to do this later

* This is not (statistically) the best way to approach this problem

* It's a good illustration, and in my experience there are lots of times where
this approach works well, even if this particular example is a bit artificial

## What is the relation between personal consumption expenditures (`pce`) and the unemployment percentage over time?

--
**Problem:** We don't have the percentage. Let's compute!

--

### You try first!

`r countdown::countdown(4)`

---

```{r perc}
perc <- map(by_year, ~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop))
str(perc)
```

---
# Fit the models

Fit a model of the form `lm(percent ~ pce)` to each year

### You try first!

`r countdown::countdown(3)`

--
```{r many-models}
mods <- map(perc, ~lm(percent ~ pce, data = .x))
str(mods)
```

---
# Extract coefficients

### You try first

Hint: use `coef`. For example, see `coef(mods[[1]])`

`r countdown::countdown(2)`

--
```{r coefs}
coefs <- map(mods, coef)
coefs[c(1:2, length(coefs))]
```

---
# Extract slopes
AKA - the coefficient that is not the intercept
### You try first

`r countdown::countdown(2)`

--
```{r slopes}
slopes <- map_dbl(coefs, 2)
slopes
```

---
# Plot

* I trust you can do this

```{r plot-slopes, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
relation <- tibble(year = names(slopes),
                   slope = slopes)

ggplot(relation, aes(slope)) +
	geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue",
	               color = "white")
```

---
# Piping
We could also have done the previous in a pipeline. 

```{r pipeline1}
by_year %>%
	map(~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop))
```

---
```{r pipeline2}
by_year %>%
	map(~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop)) %>%
	map(~lm(percent ~ pce, data = .x))
```

---
```{r pipeline3}
by_year %>%
	map(~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop)) %>%
	map(~lm(percent ~ pce, data = .x)) %>%
	map(coef)
```

---
```{r pipeline4}
slopes <- by_year %>%
	map(~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop)) %>%
	map(~lm(percent ~ pce, data = .x)) %>%
	map(coef) %>%
	map_dbl(2)
slopes
```

# More Practice 
## If we have time before the lab

---
# Practice
* Compute the standard deviation of every mtcars column.
* Copy and run the following code to obtain 50 bootstrap samples

```{r bootstrap}
bootstrap <- function(df) {
  df[sample(nrow(df), replace = TRUE), , drop = FALSE]
}
samples <- map(1:50, ~bootstrap(mtcars))
```

* Fit the following model to each bootstrap sample: `mpg ~ disp`
* Extract $R^2$ and plot the distribution
