It's required you make this joke when talking about shiny
(especially if you're a parent of young kids)

---
# The basics!
Do the following:
* Create a new R project
* Select "Shiny Web Application"
* Select the directory
* Click "create project"

[demo]

---
# First thing - Run App!
* I like to open in the browser

* What's going on here? Talk with your neighbor and see if you can deduce the
basic functionality.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 2)`


---
# UI 

* The `ui` defines the look and feel of the app - the user interface

* Use it to define where output "lives"

* It also defines the inputs for the `server`, where functions are actually
evaluated.

* In this case - we have defined a `sliderInput`, which we're calling `"bins"`.
It will take on values from 1 to 50, and will start at 30.

* Access the specific value the user selects within the `server`, through `input$bins`.


---
# Server

* The `server` function takes the input from the UI and puts it in normal R code.

* In this case, we're creating one output object, called `distPlot`. The result is then called through the `ui` on line 30

* Try removing lines 39-44, and replacing it with `print(input$bins)`


--
* Feels like it should work, but it doesn't. Any ideas why?


---
# Text output

We are no longer rendering a plot. We are rendering text. 

We need to change `renderPlot` to `renderText` and `plotOutput` to `textOutput`. 


--
## Try

Does it work now?



---
# Challenge
* Try producing essentially the same thing as the default, but use `ggplot` instead of base plotting.

* Reminder, the data are called `faithful`, and you'll be showing the distribution of `waiting`

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10)`

---
class: inverse-red middle
# [demo]

---
# Change the input
* Let's say instead of a slider, we want 5 options: 1, 5, 20, 50, or 100


--
* We can change the input from a slider (representing continuous intervals) to radio buttons, representing discrete choices.


--
* Just change `sliderInput` to `radioButtons`, and put in the appropriate `choices`. You can also add a `selected` argument for which it defaults to.


--
### Try it out!

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5)`

---
class: inverse-red middle
# [demo]

---
# More complicated
* Show distribution of highway mpg that could be faceted by `year`, `trans`, or `class`.

* Keep slider to control bins.

* Use `radioButtons` for the variables, and `sliderInput` for the bins.

* You'll need to create a second entry to your `ui` 

* Use the `mpg` dataset (from **ggplot2**)


[demo]

---
* Change the width of the sidebar with `sidebarPanel(width = 2)` if you want

* Change the height of the main panel plot with `plotOutput("distPlot", height = "800px")` if you want


[demo]


---
# Tables

* My recommendation: Use one of the following: 

  + `DT::datatable`
  + `reactable::reactable`


--
* Let's build a table to go below our distribution(s) that shows `mean`, `sd`, `min`, and `max` of the corresponding distribution(s)


--
* You'll need to create a new output object in the server, and tell the ui where it should be rendered


---
* Use `renderDataTable` in the server and `dataTableOutput` in the ui or `renderReactable` and `reactableOutput`


--
* If you want to use `{dplyr}`, as I would, then you have to deal with NSE. In this case it's not that big of a deal though. Just use `!!sym(input$var)`, where `sym` transforms a string to a symbol.


[demo]

---
# Last thing before break
### Change the layout

* Let's say instead of having the table below, we wanted it within a tabset


--
* Just create a `tabsetPanel` within the `mainPanel`, then put the output for each tab within `tabPanel`.


--
[demo]


---
class: inverse-red middle
# Break

`r countdown::countdown(5)`


---
# Alternative

* You might want to have a navbar at the top of the page, which you can create with `navbarPage()`.


--
* Create each page with `tabPanel()`


--
* Each `tabPanel` needs to include everything, including the `sidebarPanel()` (if present), could include `tabsetPanel()`, `mainPanel()`, etc.


--
* Move your title so it's `navbarPage("App title",` or the rest of the pages won't look right

--
* Make sure not to share `inputId`'s across pages - it won't work.


---
# Conclusions
* Shiny is super customizable - just scratched the surface today

* [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org)  should be your guide for going deeper

* Great for building interactive plots, but you can use it for all sorts of other things too (including text and tables)

* Apps get complicated quickly

  + Consider pulling pieces out as a refactoring method or using [shiny modules](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html)

# Shiny dashboards

---
### First dashboard - ui
```{r dashboard1-ui, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Basic dashboard"),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody(
    # Boxes need to be put in a row (or column)
    fluidRow(
      box(plotOutput("plot1", height = 250)),

      box(
        title = "Controls",
        sliderInput("slider", "Number of observations:", 1, 100, 50)
      )
    )
  )
)
```

---
# First dashboard - server

```{r dashboard1-server, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  set.seed(122)
  histdata <- rnorm(500)

  output$plot1 <- renderPlot({
    data <- histdata[seq_len(input$slider)]
    hist(data)
  })
}
```

--
### Run it

```{r, run-dashboard, eval = FALSE}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

[demo]

---
# Main differences
* You now have `dashboardSidebar` and `dashboardBody`

* You also now have `fluidRow` and `box` arguments to arrange things in the main
body


---
# Sidebar
* Probably the defining characteristic of the dashboard

  + Define a `sidebarMenu` with `menuItem`s


--
### Example

```{r sidebar, eval = FALSE}
sidebarMenu(
  menuItem("Histogram", tabName = "histo", icon = icon("chart-bar")),
  menuItem("Bin Counts", tabName = "bins", icon = icon("table"))
)
```

You can also do things like put the slider in the `sidebarMenu`

[demo]

---
# Referencing menu items

* If you define `menuItem`s, you'll have to give them a `tabName` (see previous
slide).

* In the `dashboardBody`, create a `tabItems` with specific `tabItem` pieces.
  This should be how you control/refer to the `menuItem`.


[demo]

---
# Put slider in sidebar

In this case, it's less than ideal to have the slider separated.

Instead, we can put it right in the sidebar

Bonus - it can then control things across tabs

[demo]

---
# More complicated
Use the `forcats::gss_cat` dataset

* Plots on one page
  + boxplots, with `tvhours` on y-axis
  + counts of x variable
  + proportion of x variable

* Table on another page

* Select the variable for x-axis on the sidebar

* Variable selection should produce table with means by the variable

[walkthrough]

---
# Extension

* There's lots of extensions for shiny, and quite a few (but not as many) for shinydashboard

* Consider themeing shiny apps with [{shinythemes}](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/) and dashboards with [{dashboardthemes}](https://github.com/nik01010/dashboardthemes)

* Consider themeing figures to match your shiny theme with [{thematic}](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/)

# Reactivity

My guess - we're mostly out of time, but these slides are here just in case.

---
# What is it?
* What you've been doing when writing shiny code

--

* Specify a graph of dependencies 

  + When an input changes, all related output is updated


---
# Inputs 

* `input` is a basically a list object that contains objects from the ui

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100)
)
```

After writing this code, `input$count` will be a available in the server, and the value it takes will depend on the browser input (starting at 100)


--
These are read-only, and cannot be modified


---
# Selective read permissions
It must be in a reactive context, or it won't work. 


--
That's why this results in an error

```{r eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  print(paste0("The value of input$count is ", input$count))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
# > Error in .getReactiveEnvironment()$currentContext() : 
# >  Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. 
# > (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)
```

---
# Output

* The `output` object is similar to `input`, in terms of being a list-like object.

* Create new components of the list for new output, and refer to them in the UI

* These also need to be in reactive contexts (e.g., `render*`)


---
# Simple example

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#reactive-programming)]

Try this app. Type the letters in one at a time. Notice how it updates.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")
  })
}
```

---
# Programming style
* Notice you don't have to "run" the code each time the input updates

* Your app provides instructions to R. Shiny decides when it actually runs the code.


--
### This is known as declarative programming


--
Normal R code is *imperative* programming - you decide when it's run. Declarative programming means you provide instructions, but don't actually run it.


--
> you describe your overall goals, and the software figures out how to achieve them

# Reactive graph

.footnote[image from [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#the-reactive-graph)]

* Normally, you understand R code by running it top to bottom

* This doesn't work with shiny

* Instead, we think through reactive graphs

# [reactlog](https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/)

![](http://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/readme-images/pythagoras.gif)

---
# Basic example

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(reactlog)

reactlog_enable()

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)

# close app, then
reactlogShow()
```

---
# Conclusions
* Shiny is super customizable - almost limitless (see more examples [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/))

* shinydashboard provides, basically, an alternative layout

* Really helpful and fun way to build data tools for practitioners

* Takes some practice, but basically allows you to write normal R code, and get interactive websites

# Next time
## More Shiny
Specifically we'll talk more about reactivity and, perhaps, shiny modules
