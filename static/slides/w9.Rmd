# Agenda
* Introduce reactivity

* Some shiny best practices

---
# Learning objectives
* Have at least a basic understanding of reactivity

* Recognize use cases where your functional programming skills can help make more efficient and/or clear apps


---
# Increase readability
* As I've mentioned, shiny apps can become unreadable quickly


--
Consider creating objects for each piece, possibly even in separate R files.

---
# Example

```{r eval = FALSE}
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar(
  sidebarMenu(
    menuItem("Histogram", tabName = "histo", icon = icon("chart-bar")),
    sliderInput("slider", "Number of observations:", 1, 100, 50)
  )
)

body <- dashboardBody(
  fluidRow(
    tabItems(
      tabItem(
        "histo",
        box(plotOutput("plot1", height = 250))
      )
    )
  )
)
```

---
# UI part

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Basic dashboard"),
  sidebar,
  body
)
```

--
Note you could create intermediary objects within each of the `sidebar` and `body` parts as well.

# reactivity

---
# What is it?
* What you've been doing when writing shiny code

--

* Specify a graph of dependencies 

  + When an input changes, all related output is updated


---
# Inputs 

* `input` is basically a list object that contains objects from the ui

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100)
)
```

After writing this code, `input$count` will be a available in the server, and the value it takes will depend on the browser input (starting at 100)


--
These are read-only, and cannot be modified


---
# Selective read permissions
It must be in a reactive context, or it won't work. 


--
That's why this results in an error

```{r eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  print(paste0("The value of input$count is ", input$count))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
# > Error in .getReactiveEnvironment()$currentContext() : 
# >  Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. 
# > (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)
```

---
# Output

* The `output` object is similar to `input`, in terms of being a list-like object.

* Create new components of the list for new output, and refer to them in the UI

* These also need to be in reactive contexts (e.g., `render*`)


---
# Simple example

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#reactive-programming)]

Try this app. Type the letters in one at a time. Notice how it updates.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

---
# Programming style
* Notice you don't have to "run" the code each time the input updates

* Your app provides instructions to R. Shiny decides when it actually runs the code.


--
### This is known as declarative programming


--
Normal R code is *imperative* programming - you decide when it's run. Declarative programming means you provide instructions, but don't actually run it.


--
> you describe your overall goals, and the software figures out how to achieve them

# Reactive graph

.footnote[image from [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html#the-reactive-graph)]

* Normally, you understand R code by running it top to bottom

* This doesn't work with shiny

* Instead, we think through reactive graphs

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/056990a803a41501e2dbe05df351f8b8f7b493ab/f773a/diagrams/basic-reactivity/graph-1b.png)

---
# [reactlog](https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/)

![](http://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/readme-images/pythagoras.gif)

---
# Basic example

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(reactlog)

reactlog_enable()

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste0("Hello ", input$name, "!")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)

# close app, then
reactlogShow()
```

---
# Why reactivity?

Imagine we want to have a simple app converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius


--
Do this with variables

```{r }
temp_f <- 72
temp_c <- (temp_f - 32) * (5/9)
temp_c
```

--
But changing `temp_f` has no impact on `temp_c`

```{r }
temp_f <- 50
temp_c
```

---
# Use a function?
Let's instead make this a function that depends on the object in the global environment.

```{r }
to_celsius <- function() {
  (temp_f - 32) * (5/9)
}
to_celsius()
temp_f <- 30
to_celsius()
```

--
This works, but it's less than ideal computationally. 

Even if `temp_f` hasn't changed, the conversion is re-computed

--
Not a big deal in this case, but often is.


---
# Reactive alternative

First create a reactive variable

```{r }
library(shiny)
reactiveConsole(TRUE)
temp_f <- reactiveVal(72)
temp_f()
temp_f(50)
temp_f()
```

---
# Reactive function
Next create a reactive function

```{r }
to_celsius <- reactive({
  message("Converting...")
  (temp_f() - 32) * (5/9)
})
```

--

Now it will convert **only** when the value of `temp_f()` changes

---

.pull-left[

```{r message = TRUE}
to_celsius()
to_celsius()

temp_f(100)
to_celsius()
to_celsius()
```

]

--

.pull-right[

Unless the value of `temp_f` changes, the code will not be re-run.

]

# An app example

Please follow along

We'll build an app to show the results of different regression models.


---
# First, an extension!

We want to be able to select which variables are predictors in the model. 

Ideally, we should be able to select 1, 2, ... $n$ predictors.


--

`shinyWidgets::multiInput()` to the rescue!


---
# Super basic example

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(shinyWidgets)
library(palmerpenguins)

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Regression Example"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      multiInput(
        inputId = "xvars",
        label = "Select predictor variables :",
        choices = names(penguins)[-3], # column 3 will be outcome
        selected = "island"
      )
    ),
    mainPanel(

    )
  )
)
```

---
# Leave the server blank
## Try!

```{r eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {

}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

[demo]

---
# Write the server
* We now want it to fit a model with `bill_length_mm` as the outcome, and whatever variables are selected as predictors


--
* We can do this by creating a *reactive* model, that only is estimated when something changes.


---
# Example

```{r }
  model <- reactive({
    form <- paste(
      "bill_length_mm ~ ", 
      paste(input$xvars, collapse = " + ")
    )
    
    lm(as.formula(form), penguins)
  })
```


The above creates a string, which is then converted to a formula

--

It will only be estimated when `input$xvars` is changed


--
We can refer to the model object elsewhere in our server with `model()`.


---
# Build a table

* Use the [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) and [gtsummary](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) packages to  pull the model coefficients

* Render the result in **gt** table


--
Remember to load additional packages

```{r }
library(shiny)
library(shinyWidgets)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(gtsummary) #<<
library(gt) #<<
```

---
In the server:

```{r eval = FALSE}
output$tbl <- render_gt({
  as_gt(tbl_regression(model(), intercept = TRUE))
})
```


--
In the `mainPanel()` of the `ui`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gt_output("tbl")
```


--
## Try!

[demo]


---
# Make it fancier

* Let's add an equation with [equatiomatic](https://datalorax.github.io/equatiomatic/).


--
You try first:

* Use `extract_eq()` to extract the equation, and the `renderEq()` and `eqOutput()` functions for shiny.

* Make sure to include `withMathJax()` in your `ui` somewhere (I put it after the title).

* Check out the help page for `extract_eq()` for additional arguments, including `use_coefs`, and play around with these options.

`r countdown::countdown(6)`


--
[demo]


---
# Going further

* Partial regression plots? (see [visreg](https://pbreheny.github.io/visreg/)).

* The more we add, the more we might want to think about layouts - maybe a dashboard would be preferred?

* Could make it so you can change the outcome as well (but this gets a bit tricky)

* Others?

# Some shiny best practices

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. â€” Martin Fowler

---
# Things to consider

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/best-practices.html)]

* Are variable/function names clear and concise?

* Is code commented, where needed?

* Is there a way to break up complex functions?

* Are there many instances of copy/pasting?

* Can I manage different components of my app independently? Or are they too tangled together?

---
# Functions

### Something new I learned

Last time I showed you how to `source()` files. It turns out you don't need to do this!

* Create a new folder, `R/`

* Place `.R` files in that folder

* shiny will source them automatically!!

---
# UI example

.footnote[Example from [Mastering Shiny]()]

Imagine we have a bunch of different sliders we want to create. We could do something like this:

```{r }
ui <- fluidRow(
  sliderInput("alpha", "alpha", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1),
  sliderInput("beta",  "beta",  min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1),
  sliderInput("gamma", "gamma", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1),
  sliderInput("delta", "delta", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1)
)
```


--
Ideas on how you could write a function to reduce the amount of code here?

---
# Slider function

```{r }
my_slider <- function(id) {
  sliderInput(id, id, min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.5, step = 0.1)
}
ui <- fluidRow(
  my_slider("alpha"),
  my_slider("beta"),
  my_slider("gamma"),
  my_slider("delta")
)
```

--
Anyway to make this even less repetitive?

---
# Loop through the ids

```{r }
ids <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta")
sliders <- map(ids, my_slider)
ui <- fluidRow(sliders)
```

---
# Other use cases

* Maybe you want to use a shiny function, but assign it with some standard formatting
  - e.g., icons

* Maybe there are functions where you only want to change 1-3 things? Create a function that allows you to modify those, but keep other things at the values you want

---
# Server functions

* I often find it helpful to create functions for output, even if I'm not repeating them a lot
  + Can help keep server code clean and concise
  
* Inspect your code and consider refactoring in a similar way you would standard functions

* Consider keeping these in a separate `.R` file from your UI functions

# shiny modules
(briefly)

---
# What is a module?

* Allows you to modularize parts of your shiny app

* This can help "de-tangle" these pices from the rest of the app

* Primarily useful when the thing you want to modularize spans *both* the UI and the server

---
# Example
### No modules

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html)]

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/051011ce1a1bc8989ae41b735b05b607b2ebde65/2e519/diagrams/scaling-modules/before.png)


---
# Example
### Same app, but with modules

.footnote[From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html)]

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d9a229fec717ef7bfda8e17a9c9d4fdc66b8b08/953f7/diagrams/scaling-modules/after.png)

---
# Create modules

* It's fairly complicated. See the [chapter](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html) from Mastering Shiny on the topic

* Probably not worth it until you're creating complicated apps, but I wanted to make you aware of them


--
Let's look at a very basic use case from [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html#module-basics)

---
# The original app

```{r eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput("var", "Variable", names(mtcars)),
  numericInput("bins", "bins", 10, min = 1),
  plotOutput("hist")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  data <- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])

  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    hist(
      x = data(),
      breaks = input$bins,
      main = input$var
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


---
# Histogram UI module

* A function for the UI components of the histogram

* Wrap all internals into a single function with an `id` argument

* Wrap all inputs in a `tagList()`, with inputs separated by commmas

* Wrap each ID in `NS()`
  + Allows the multiple id's to be referenced by a single id
  
---
```{r }
uiHist <- function(id) {
  tagList(
    selectInput(NS(id, "var"), "Variable", names(mtcars)),
    numericInput(NS(id, "bins"), "bins", 10, min = 1),
    plotOutput(NS(id, "hist"))
  )
}
```


---
# Histogram server module
* Wrap the internals in a function with an `id` argument
* Inside this function, wrap the internals again with the `moduleServer()` function
  + First argument is `id`
  + Second argument is `function(input, output, session) { <internals> }`

---

```{r }
serverHist <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    data <- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])

    output$hist <- renderPlot({
      hist(
        x = data(),
        breaks = input$bins,
        main = input$var
      )
    })
  })
}
```


---
# New app

```{r }
ui <- fluidPage(
  uiHist("histo")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  serverHist("histo")
}
```

--
The modules can then live in their own files, and your UI and server functions become much more clean

---
# Conclusions
* Shiny is fun!

* Bigger apps get pretty complicated pretty quickly

* Consider modules

* Do try to be efficient with your code whenever possible

* Think carefully about reactivity - it's a fundamentally different approach.

---
# Any time left?

### Challenge

* Create a shiny app or shiny dashboard with the `palmerpenguins` dataset

* Allow the x and y axis to be selected by the user
  + These should be any numeric variables
  
* Allow the points to be colored by any categorical variable

  + For an added challenge, try to add in a "no color" option, which should be the default
