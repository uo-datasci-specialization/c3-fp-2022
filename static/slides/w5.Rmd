# Agenda
* Discuss `map2_*` and `pmap_*` (parallel iterations)

* `walk()` and friends

* `modify()`

* `safely()`

* `reduce()`

---
# Learning objectives
* Understand the differences between `map`, `map2`, and `pmap`

* Know when to apply `walk` instead of `map`, and why it may be useful

* Understand the similarities and differences between `map` and `modify`

* Diagnose errors with `safely` and understand other situations where it may
be helpful

* Collapsing/reducing lists with `purrr::reduce()` or `base::Reduce()`

# A few Examples
Basic simulations - iterating over two vectors

Plots by month, changing the title

---
# Simulation
* Simulate data from a normal distribution

	+ Vary $n$ from 5 to 150 by increments of 5
	
--
	
	+ For each $n$, vary $\mu$ from -2 to 2 by increments of 0.25


--
### How do we get all combinations

--
`expand.grid`

---
# Example `expand.grid`
### Bonus: It turns it into a data frame!
```{r expand.grid}
ints <- 1:3
lets <- c("a", "b", "c")
expand.grid(ints, lets)
```

---
# Set conditions

Please follow along

```{r sim-conditions}
conditions <- expand.grid(
  n = seq(5, 150, 5),
  mu = seq(-2, 2, 0.25)
)
```

.pull-left[
```{r }
head(conditions)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r }
tail(conditions)
```
]

---
# Simulate!

```{r sim1}
sim1 <- map2(conditions$n, conditions$mu, ~{
    rnorm(n = .x, mean = .y, sd = 10)
})
str(sim1)
```

---
# More powerful
### Add it as a list column!

```{r list-column-sim1}
sim2 <- conditions %>%
  as_tibble() %>% # Not required, but definitely helpful
  mutate(sim = map2(n, mu, ~rnorm(n = .x, mean = .y, sd = 10))) 
sim2
```

---
# Unnest

```{r list-column-sim2}
conditions %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(sim = map2(n, mu, ~rnorm(.x, .y, sd = 10))) %>%
  unnest(sim)
```

---
# Challenge

Can you replicate what we just did, but using a `rowwise()` approach?

# Save all plots

We'll have to iterate across at least two things: (a) file path/names, and (b)
the plots themselves


--
We can do this with the `map()` family, but instead we'll use a different function, which we'll talk about more momentarily.


--
As an aside, what are the **steps** we would need to take to do this?


--
Could we use a `nest_by()` solution?

---
# Try with `nest_by()`

You try first:
* Create a vector of file paths
* "loop" through the file paths and the plots to save them

`r countdown::countdown(4)`

---
# Example

### Create a directory
```{r }
fs::dir_create(here::here("plots", "pulitzers"))
```

--
### Create file paths
```{r }
files <- str_replace_all(
  tolower(final_plots$newspaper),
  " ",
  "-"
)
paths <- here::here("plots", "pulitzers", glue("{files}.png"))
paths
```

---
# Add paths to data frame
```{r }
final_plots %>% 
  ungroup() %>% #<<
  mutate(path = paths) %>% 
  select(plots, path)
```

---
# Save
```{r }
final_plots %>% 
  ungroup() %>% #<<
  mutate(path = paths) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% #<<
  summarize(
    ggsave(
      path, 
      plots, 
      width = 9.5, 
      height = 6.5,
      dpi = 500
    )
  )
```

---
# Wrap-up
* Parallel iterations greatly increase the things you can do - iterating through at least two things simultaneously is pretty common


--
* The `nest_by()` approach can regularly get you the same result as `group_by() %>% nest() %>% mutate() %>% map()`

  + Caveat - must be in a data frame, which means working with list columns
  
--
* My view - it's still worth learning both. Looping with **{purrr}** is super flexible and often safer than base versions (type safe). Doesn't have to be used within a data frame.

# Break

class: inverse-red middle
# Looping variants

---
# Agenda
* `walk()` and friends

* `modify()`

* `safely()`

* `reduce()`

---
# Reminder
## Learning Objectives (for this part)

* Know when to apply `walk` instead of `map`, and why it may be useful

* Understand the parallels and differences between `map` and `modify`

* Diagnose errors with `safely` and understand other situations where it may
be helpful

* Collapsing/reducing lists with `purrr::reduce()` or `base::Reduce()`

---
# Setup
Let's go back to our plotting example:

## Saving
* We saw last time that we could use `nest_by()`
  + Required a bit of awkwardness with adding the paths to the data frame
  
--
* Instead, we'll do it again but with the `walk()` family


---
# Why `walk()`?

> Walk is an alternative to map that you use when you want to call a function for its side effects, rather than for its return value. You typically do this because you want to render output to the screen or save files to disk - the important thing is the action, not the return value.

\-[r4ds](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#walk)

---
class: inverse-red middle
# More practical
If you use `walk()`, nothing will get printed to the screen. This is particularly helpful for RMarkdown files.

---
# Example
Please do the following
* Create a new RMarkdown document
* Paste the code you have for creating the plots in a code chunk there (along with the library loading, data cleaning, etc.)

`r countdown::countdown(3)`

---
# Create a directory

We already did this, but in case we hadn't...
```{r }
fs::dir_create(here::here("plots", "pulitzers"))
```

--
### Create file paths
```{r }
newspapers <- str_replace_all(
  tolower(final_plots$newspaper),
  " ",
  "-"
)
paths <- here::here(
  "plots",
  "pulitzers",
  glue("{newspapers}.png")
)
```

---
# Challenge
* Use a `map()` family function to loop through `paths` and `final_plots$plots` to save all plots. 

* Render (knit) your file. What do you notice?

`r countdown::countdown(3)`

---
# `walk()`
Just like `map()`, we have parallel variants of `walk()`, including, `walk2()`, and `pwalk()`

These work just like `map()` but don't print to the screen

Try replacing your prior code with a `walk()` version. 

How does the rendered output change?

`r countdown::countdown(2)`


---
# Save plots

```{r walk2, eval = FALSE}
walk2(paths, final_plots$plots, ggsave,
      width = 9.5, 
      height = 6.5,
      dpi = 500)
```

> Unlike `map()` and its variants which always return a fixed object type (list for `map()`, integer vector for `map_int()`, etc), the `modify()` family always returns the same type as the input object.

---
# `map` vs `modify`
### map

```{r map-mtcars}

# safely

---
# Errors during iterations

Sometimes a loop will work for most cases, but return an error on a few


--
Often, you want to return the output you can


--
Alternatively, you might want to diagnose *where* the error is occurring


--
`purrr::safely()`


---
# Example
```{r by_cyl}
by_cyl <- mpg %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  nest() 
by_cyl
```

Please run the code above

`r countdown::countdown(1)`

---
# Try to fit a model

(please follow along)

Notice the error message is *super* helpful! (this is new)

```{r lm-fail, error = TRUE}
by_cyl %>% 
  mutate(mod = map(data, ~lm(hwy ~ displ + drv, data = .x)))
```

---
# Safe return

* First, define safe function - note that this will work for .ital[.b[any]] function
```{r safe-lm}
safe_lm <- safely(lm)
```


--

* Next, loop the safe function, instead of the standard function


--

```{r loop-safe-lm}
safe_models <- by_cyl %>% 
  mutate(safe_mod = map(data, ~safe_lm(hwy ~ displ + drv, data = .x)))
safe_models
```

---
# What's returned?

```{r safe-return}
safe_models$safe_mod[[1]]
safe_models$safe_mod[[4]]
```


---
# Inspecting
I often use `safely()` to help me de-bug. Why is it failing *there* (but note the new error messages help with this too).


--
First - create a new variable to filter for results with errors

--
```{r }
safe_models %>% 
  mutate(error = map_lgl(safe_mod, ~!is.null(.x$error)))
```

---
# Inspecting the data
```{r }
safe_models %>% 
  mutate(error = map_lgl(safe_mod, ~!is.null(.x$error))) %>% 
  filter(isTRUE(error)) %>% 
  select(cyl, data) %>% 
  unnest(data)
```

The `displ` and `drv` variables are constant, so no relation can be estimated.


---
# Pull results that worked

```{r results}
safe_models %>% 
  mutate(results = map(safe_mod, "result"))
```

--
Now we can `broom::tidy()` or whatevs

---

Notice that there is no `cyl == 5`.

```{r }
safe_models %>% 
  mutate(results = map(safe_mod, "result"),
         tidied = map(results, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(cyl, tidied) %>% 
  unnest(tidied)
```

---
# When else might we use this?

--

Any sort of web scraping - pages change and URLs don't always work

---
# Example

```{r error = TRUE}
library(rvest)
links <- list(
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona",
  "https://nosuchpage",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"
)
pages <- map(links, ~{
  Sys.sleep(0.1)
  read_html(.x)
})
```

---
# The problem
I can't connect to https://nosuchpage because it doesn't exist


--
.center[.blue[.realbig[BUT]]]


--
That also means I can't get *any* of my links because *one* page errored (imagine it was 1 in 1,000 instead of 1 in 3)


--
## `safely()` to the rescue

---
# Safe version

```{r }
safe_read_html <- safely(read_html)
pages <- map(links, ~{
  Sys.sleep(0.1)
  safe_read_html(.x)
})
str(pages)
```

---
# Non-results
In a real example, we'd probably want to double-check the pages where we got no results

--
```{r }
errors <- map_lgl(pages, ~!is.null(.x$error))
links[errors]
```

# reduce

---
# Reducing a list
The `map()` family of functions will always return a vector the same length as the input


--
`reduce()` will collapse or reduce the list to a single element

---
# Example

```{r }
l <- list(
  c(1, 3),
  c(1, 5, 7, 9),
  3,
  c(4, 8, 12, 2)
)

reduce(l, sum)
```

---
# Compare to `map()`

```{r }
map(l, sum)
```

---
# What's going on?
The code `reduce(l, sum)` is the same as

```{r }
sum(l[[4]], sum(l[[3]], sum(l[[1]], l[[2]])))
```

Or slidghlty differently
```{r }
first_sum <- sum(l[[1]], l[[2]])
second_sum <- sum(first_sum, l[[3]])
final_sum <- sum(second_sum, l[[4]])
final_sum
```

---
# Why might you use this?
What if you had a list of data frames like this

```{r }
l_df <- list(
  tibble(id = 1:3, score = rnorm(3)),
  tibble(id = 1:5, treatment = rbinom(5, 1, .5)),
  tibble(id = c(1, 3, 5, 7), other_thing = rnorm(4))
)
```

We can join these all together with a single loop - we want the output to be of length 1!

---
```{r }
reduce(l_df, full_join)
```

---
Note - you have to be careful on directionality


```{r }
reduce(l_df, left_join)
reduce(l_df, right_join)
```

---
# Another example
You probably just want to `bind_rows()`

```{r }
l_df2 <- list(
  tibble(id = 1:3, scid = 1, score = rnorm(3)),
  tibble(id = 1:5, scid = 2, score = rnorm(5)),
  tibble(id = c(1, 3, 5, 7), scid = 3, score = rnorm(4))
)
reduce(l_df2, bind_rows)
```

---
# Non-loop version

Luckily, the prior slide has become obsolete, because `bind_rows()` will do the list reduction for us.

```{r }
bind_rows(l_df2)
```


---
# Another example

This is a poor example, but there are use cases like this

```{r }
library(palmerpenguins)
map(penguins, as.character) %>% 
  reduce(paste)
```


---
# Why use `reduce()`

This is one that I use a fair bit, but have a hard time coming up with good examples for.

The tidyverse makes it less needed, generally.

Still a good "tool" to have

---
# Wrap up
* Lots more to `{purrr}` but we've covered a lot
  
* Functional programming can *really* help your efficiency, and even if it slows you down initially, I'd recommend always striving toward it, because it will ultimately be a huge help.
